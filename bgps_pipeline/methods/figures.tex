molecular emission lines are shown at their rest frequencies.  For
comparison, the MAMBO-2 bandpass is shown as a thin line.  Note that
the Bolocam passband rejects $>90\%$ of the $^{12}$CO flux, leaving
our continuum measurements largely uncontaminated.  SO$_2$ and
CH$_3$OH lines are likely strong contributors to line flux in the
passband.  \citet{nummelin1998} found that 22\% of the flux density in
one pointing towards Sgr B2 was from lines, and \citet{yoshida2005}
reported $>40\%$ in Orion A from line emission over the 260-328 GHz
band. Other lines lying in the Bolocam passband include CS($5\to4$)
and ($6\to5$) (245 and 293 GHz), HCN($3\to2$) (265 GHz) and
HCO$^+(3\to2)$ (267 GHz).  }

drops to 50\% at 120\arcsec for the 13 PCA component cleaning used in
the released data.  The 3 and 7 PCA cases show bumps because
atmospheric noise is still present at large scales.  The $>$100\%
recovery for simulated sources smaller than the deconvolution kernel
is a side-effect; since the deconvolution kernel is smaller than the
beam, no real astrophysical source should ever be smaller than the
kernel.  \emph{Right}: 7.2\arcsec (cyan), 14.4\arcsec (black),
