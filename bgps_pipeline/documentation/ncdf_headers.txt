eaz                                 [time]                   :  error OFFSET in azimuth - ESSENTIAL!  I don't know what it is, but if it isn't added (correctly!) to the position vector, sources get stretched. Difference between what antenna computer told telescope to do and what it actually did.  Motors can't quite keep up with commanded positions.

beam_locations                      [bolodim, bolo_param]    :  beam locations inserted from a properly formatted beam locations file.  The beam locations are derived from distortion maps calculated from oversampled mapping of planets
array_params                        [array_param]            :  5 parameters : platescale in arcsec per mm, beamsize FWHM in arcsec, fiducial array angle in degrees, x and y boresight offset in inches.  x and y in this case have been assumed to be azimuth/zenith angle, and they are corrections to the offsets that are applied from the telescope pointing software's reported az/el that are NOT included in the ncdf files.  The data was never completely merged, apparently
bolo_params                         [bolodim, bolo_param]    :  bolo_params from a bolo_params file.  Includes flags for bad bolometers (bad is zero, good is 1), and bolometer locations specified in polar coordinates relative to the array center.  Same information as beam_locations, but is not measured - is probably 'fiducial'
