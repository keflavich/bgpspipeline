First few hundred lines:  Ridiculous amounts of parameter parsing.  DEFINITELY
overdone, should have been split into functions.

Line 447-451: read bolo_params
466-470: correct for array params offets (should be zero)
472-485: "correct for" fiducial angle by multiplying the x,y offset vector by
    the fiducial angle rotation matrix
514-697: automated outlier rejection (why wasn't this a separate function?)


Net result: does JACK SHIT.
